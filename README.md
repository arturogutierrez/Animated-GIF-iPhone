# Animated-Gif-iOS

Library for effective memory optimized GIF playback in iOS. This library will not prepare all frames at once, but will update frames in live. So in this way memory usage is strongly decreased, but CPU usage is increased (because gif decoding).

#Installation
##With cocoapods
Use this lines in podfile:
```
platform :ios, '5.0'
pod "Animated-Gif-iOS"
```

##From sources
Copy following files to your project: `AnimatedGif.h`, `AnimatedGif.m`,`UIImageView+AnimatedGif.h`,`UIImageView+AnimatedGif.m`.

# Example usage

Creating a imageview with GIF content:
```
AnimatedGif * gif = [AnimatedGif getAnimationForGifAtUrl:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://s6.pikabu.ru/post_img/2014/04/07/6/1396854652_1659897712.gif"]];
UIImageView * newImageView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 20, 300, 200)];
[newImageView setAnimatedGif:gif];
[gif setLoadingProgressBlock:^(AnimatedGif *obj, CGFloat progress) {
    progressView.progress = progress;
}];
[gif setWillShowFrameBlock:^(AnimatedGif *obj, UIImage *img) {
    progressView.hidden = YES;
    //... Do stuff
}];
[gif start];
[self.view addSubview:newImageView];
...
//Another way
NSData * animationData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"1.gif" ofType:nil]];
AnimatedGif * animation = [AnimatedGif getAnimationForGifWithData:animationData];
UIImageView * newImageView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 20, 300, 200)];
[newImageView setAnimatedGif:animation startImmediately:YES];
[self.view addSubview:newImageView];
```

To manage a gif imageview you can subscribe for next NSNotification events: `AnimatedGifDidStartLoadingingEvent`, `AnimatedGifDidFinishLoadingingEvent`.
```
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(animatedGifDidStart:) name:AnimatedGifDidStartLoadingingEvent object:nil];

[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(animatedGifDidFinish:) name:AnimatedGifDidFinishLoadingingEvent object:nil];
...
-(void)animatedGifDidStart:(NSNotification*) notify {
    AnimatedGif * object = notify.object;
    NSLog(@"Url will be loaded: %@", object.url);
}
-(void)animatedGifDidFinish:(NSNotification*) notify {
    AnimatedGif * object = notify.object;
    NSLog(@"Url is loaded: %@", object.url);
    ...
}
```
Also you can use block `setWillShowFrameBlock`.

See example project for an additional information.
